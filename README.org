* Overview
  [[http://melpa.org/#/ox-twiki][file:https://melpa.org/packages/ox-tiddly-badge.svg]]

  This repository provides two exporters for [[http://orgmode.org/][Emacs Org 8.x and 9.x]]. They allow
  exporting an org document to a TiddlyWiki buffer or to a Foswiki/Twiki
  buffer.

  Both exporters are loosely based on the ox-confluence exporter by
  SÃ©bastien Delafond

* Installation

  Put the *.el files into your load-path and the following into your
  ~/.emacs, or .emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-tiddly)
  (require 'ox-twiki)  
#+END_SRC

* Usage

  The following interactive commands will become available in Emacs
  - org-tiddly-export-as-tiddly
  - org-twiki-export-as-twiki

  So, when you are in an org buffer and want to export to a
  Twiki/Foswiki formatted buffer, type

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x org-twiki-export-as-twiki RET
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Notes

  The code also contains new shortcut keys for the exporter screen
  (reached by C-c C-e).  These could possibly clash with other
  expansion modules. Actually, I think they should only get
  explicitely set, once a converter has made it into the Org standard
  code base, but I left them in for my own convenience.

  I hope that these plugins will be useful to others. Org is a
  fantastic piece of software with a great community.
